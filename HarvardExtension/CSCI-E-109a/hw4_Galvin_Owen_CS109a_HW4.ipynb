    "If the \"data set\" is to be considered this particular training data set then Yes. Regularization approaches such as Ridge & Lasso regression will result in minimizing certain coefficients (and in the case of Lasso removing entirely), which will restrict overfitting and thereby reduce variance.  \n",
    "If \"data set\" refers to all 205 observations, then there is a strong possibility that a split like 75% for training will allow the use of an OLS model and regularization will not be \"needed\". Even then though, regularization will likely be beneficial, both in terms of accuracty and interpretability (69 predictors will still be a lot considering only ~200 observations).\n"

    "For the training set, lambda parameters approaching zero have little effect, it is only as value increases past 10<sup>3</sup> that the R<sup>2</sup> starts to fall.  \n",
    "With the test set, R<sup>2</sup> is extremely poor at very small levels of lambda, where the model approaches that of an OLS and overfitting is very much happening. This is followed by a very rapid increase in the range from 10<sup>-6</sup> through 10<sup>-3</sup>. After that it still increases until it reaches it's maximum value around 10<sup>-0.68</sup>, levels off for a while in periods of increasing lambda, before dipping at around 10<sup>3</sup>.  \n",
    "The dip in both R<sup>2</sup> at 10<sup>2</sup> may be due to the influence of one or more predictors being greatly reduced - their coefficient set very close to zero as lambda increases.\n"

    "#### How does the best test R^2 value obtained using Ridge regression compare with that of plain linear regression? Explain.\n",
    "Using same train/test data, best R<sup>2</sup> under Ridge regression was about 0.9123880 while that of plain linear regression was ... rather lower at a highly negative -11.3050. It is notable that this R<sup>2</sup> value is what Ridge regression model outputs with a very low lambda of around 0.00001. Linear regression weights all of the coefficients at 100% while Ridge regression is able to greatly reduce the contribution that certain predictors make to the model - not dropping them but potentially reducing their effect by a large amount. Without the shrinkage Ridge regression introduces the model produced by OLS on this data set will always overfit due to number of predictors > number of observations, leading to practically infinite variance."

    "You are provided a data set containing details of mail sent to 95,412 potential donors for a fund-raising campaign of a not-for-profit organization. This data set also contains the amount donated by each donor. The task is to build a model that can estimate the amount that a donor would donate using his/her attributes. The data is contained in the file `dataset_3.txt`. Each row contains 376 attributes for a donor, followed by the donation amount.\n",
